# Make Change Project

## Overview

This is a cash register application.
It asks the user for the amount of an item and returns the corresponding change. It also checks if the amount paid is not enough. 
If the amount paid is equal to the amount owed, there is a thank you message.


## Technologies Used

* Java
* Eclipse
* Git


## Lessons Learned
* I learned the use and importance of rounding numbers.
* I learned how to use MOD operators.


 _Overall, this was a fun weekend project to work on. As we learn more about method in the coming days, I will definitely come back to this problem and try to update it._
